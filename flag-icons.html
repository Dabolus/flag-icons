<!--
`flag-icons` is an iconset that allows you to easily display flags
on you application/website.

It features 195 flat icons with rounded corners, that can be useful if you want to allow the user to change the language in you internationalized application.

_Note: the credits for the original flags go to [Muharrem Şenyıl](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/100-flat-flag-psd-icons/).<br>
I just ported them to an iconset_

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using an iconset is extremely simple. These are the steps you need to follow:

1. Load the iconset:
   ```html
   <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/flag-icons/flag-icons.html">
   ```
2. Insert your icon using [`iron-icon`](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/iron-icon)
   ```html
   <iron-icon icon="flag:gb"></iron-icon>
   ```
3. Done!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example usage:
```html
<iron-icon icon="flag:af"></iron-icon>
<iron-icon icon="flag:al"></iron-icon>
<iron-icon icon="flag:dz"></iron-icon>
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Browse the [API docs](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/Dabolus/flag-icons) for a fully working example._
